> As an obliged entity pursuant to European KYC/AML regulations we must apply customer due diligence measures when establishing a business relationship with you.
In our customer due diligence process you are required to submit and provide us with (i) general information about the legal entity e.g. registered name, company number, country of incorporation, information about beneficial owners, directors, authorised persons; and (ii) applicable business documents e.g. certificate of incorporation, ID for relevant business personal (directors, beneficial owner and authorized person).

> The IBAN is customer-specific but managed by us. When funds are transferred to the IBAN account an automatic process will be initiated that issues e-money to your linked blockchain address. You should note that the IBAN is provided to you through our third-party partners and transactions via the IBAN are also subject to their terms and conditions see section 5. You are also able to use your IBAN to send payments via traditional payment networks such as the Single Euro Payments Area (“SEPA”). Once you have submitted a send request through our web application (hereafter referred to as “your Account” or “Account”) the corresponding value of e-money will be redeemed from your linked blockchain address.
In your Account you can view the balances of your linked addresses, receive instructions on how to add money, send money and view your transaction history.

> The IBAN and the SEPA payment services are provided by our third party payment service provider SatchelPay, UAB, with the legal code 304628112, registered address at Geležinio vilko g. 18A, Vilnius, LT-08104, Lithuania (hereafter referred to as “Satchel’’).
